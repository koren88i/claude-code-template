description: Use when a real project's `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/skills/` has improved and you want to promote the generalizable parts back into the `claude-code-template` repo. Compare if needed, strip project-specific details, and apply the improvement in the separate template repository.
---

# Template Sync

## Goal
Promote reusable improvements discovered in a real project back into the `claude-code-template` repo.

## Use this when
- A real project's `CLAUDE.md` section turned out better than the template version and should be generalized upstream
- A local skill in `.claude/skills/` was improved in a way that would help other projects too
- A skill listed under `Skills to add` in a real project has now been written and belongs in the template repo
- The user asks to contribute, upstream, promote, or carry an improvement back into `claude-code-template`

---

## Real-world setup

Treat this as a two-repo workflow:

- **Repo 1: the real project** where the improvement was discovered
- **Repo 2: the template repo** (`claude-code-template`) where the generalized improvement should land

Typical local layout:

```text
work/
  my-real-project/
  claude-code-template/
```

Preferred workflow:
- Inspect and learn in the real project
- Apply the cleaned-up improvement in the separate local clone of `claude-code-template`
- Commit and push from the template repo, not from the project repo

Optional comparison helper:
- Add the template repo as a read-only remote inside the project repo if you only need to inspect the current upstream file
- Do not treat that remote as the place to develop or push template changes

If the template repo is not available locally, ask the user for its path or prepare a patch the user can apply there later.

---

## File path mapping

The template repo and a project that uses it store files in different locations:

| Template repo | Real project |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.template.md` | `CLAUDE.md` (project root) |
| `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |

Use this mapping when copying a generalized improvement from the real project back into the template repo.

---

## Workflow

### 1) Identify the candidate improvement in the real project
Ask:
- Does this change depend on project-specific knowledge (internal hostnames, domain rules, team conventions)?
- Would it make the template better for any project, or just this one?

If the answer is "any project" — it belongs in the template. If it's project-specific — it belongs only in `CLAUDE.md` or the local skill copy.

### 2) Compare against the current template version when helpful
If the template repo is cloned locally, inspect the target file there directly.

If you only need a read-only comparison from inside the project repo, you may add and fetch a template remote:
```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/koren88i/claude-code-template.git
git fetch template
git show template/master:CLAUDE.template.md
git show template/master:skills/<name>/SKILL.md
```

Use this for reference only. The actual template change should still be made in the separate template repo.

### 3) Strip project-specific content
Before contributing back, remove or replace:
- Internal service names, hostnames, URLs
- Business domain language specific to this project
- Examples that only make sense in this codebase

Replace with generic equivalents or placeholder examples.

### 4) Apply the change in the template repo
Open the separate local clone of `claude-code-template` and edit the matching file there.

Examples:
- project `CLAUDE.md` -> template `CLAUDE.template.md`
- project `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` -> template `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

Typical flow:
```bash
cd /path/to/claude-code-template
git checkout -b improve/<topic>
# apply the cleaned-up improvement
git add CLAUDE.template.md skills/<name>/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat(template): <description of improvement>"
git push origin improve/<topic>
```

If you do not have write access:
- Fork the template repo and open a pull request, or
- prepare a patch for the maintainer to apply in the template repo

In the PR or patch notes, describe:
- what improved,
- what prompted the change in the real project,
- what was stripped or generalized before upstreaming.

### 5) Update template indexes when needed
If the improvement affects the skills index or adds a new skill, also update:
- the `## Skills available` section in `CLAUDE.template.md`
- remove the skill from `## Skills to add` if it was listed there
- the skills table in `README.md` when the change is user-visible

---

## Guardrails
- Never interpret this skill as "pull template changes into the project."
- Never push from the project repo directly into the template repo.
- Never contribute project-specific content to the template — sanitize first.
- Never overwrite the template with a raw project file without reviewing and cleaning it first.
- Use a template remote only for read-only comparison; use a separate clone for real template edits whenever possible.
- When in doubt about whether something is generalizable, leave it in the project and note it for later review.
